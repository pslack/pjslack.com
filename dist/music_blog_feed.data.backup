proved through objective third party verification.
These are the symbols and themes that I hold dear,
form the pillar of my spirituality, and paint the

<br><div>It's been a while since I've published any new music tracks. Please find here a new song track entitled "Deep Inside":</div>
<br><div>
<br><a href="http://www.pjslack.net/deepinside.mp3">http://www.pjslack.net/deepinside.mp3</a>
</div>
<br><div>
<br>I've begun a new music collection project entitled "The Love Network Voyager". The theme is intended as an exploration of love within social networks of people. Today we experience light speed communications between people from all over the globe, it seems almost a natural extension of ourselves to be able to do this. We have always been naturally blessed with light speed processes in our brains to enable memories of our life to be recalled, and with senses that can view the light from the very beginnings of the universe; we sense and recall the memory of the universe and all time.</div>
<br><div>
<br>Social networks perhaps mimic these senses,experiences and structures in some way, as if creating a toy universe inside a real universe where we can explore, create, be together. Since I was a child I have always been fascinated and addicted to communications, it somehow made me feel closer to understanding a larger picture that I could be a part of when I was able to communicate with other people in remote locations in real time. The popularity of social networks,cell phones etc. and the addictive properties, I feel, is an interesting and important topic for study in the form of a music collection. I feel it is also important to expose the positive aspects rather than things like; a guy driving his car while texting someone on his crackberry.</div>
<br><div></div>
<br><div>I had a notion this summer to pack up the recording gear and make pieces of a song in different locations. The recordings took place around a camp fire in my back yard in Erin and in my studio, at a mule farm in Tara, atop the Greystone Inn in Orangeville. This features the voices of friends Kiera Merriam and Lisa Watson and is an improvisational, electro-acoustic / new age genre piece.</div>

     Hello to all fine folks,<br><br><a href="http://www.pjslack.net/emumaoutravida.mp3">http://www.pjslack.net/emumaoutravida.mp3</a><br><br>This is an instrumental tune dedicated to AmandaMartinez and Laura Fernandez, both hosts of the Cafe Latino radio program that airs Saturdayafternoons on 91.1FM or online at <a href="http://www.jazz.fm/">http://www.jazz.fm</a> for those not in the GTA.<br><br>"Em uma outra vida" translated from Portuguesemeans "in another life".  I don't speak a word of Portuguese (and thanks to the powers that be foronline translators) but I played in a Brazilian jazz band several years back and was reminiscing,it seems like a lifetime ago, in another life.  Istarted a mini project called Cafe Latino after Iheard news that Amanda was stepping down and following her beautiful voice and that LauraFernandez (also of a beautiful voice) was taking over as host of my favorite radio show.  As with any change there is both excitement, uncertainty and we always have moments missing the life we had before changes, those inevitable blues.<br><br>The band I played with was a regular in Niagara onthe Lake and played Saturday nights at the Anchorage.  The show still goes on and is hosted by Steve Goldberger and the Niagara RhythmSection.  On my long drive into NOTL on those Saturdays we played, I always managed to be traveling the same time as Cafe Latino aired, this show always started my fire for those Saturday night Latin gigs and Amanda even spun up a recording that featured some of my playing once,my first time on air play!  Thank you Amanda!  I was fortunate to meet Amanda once many years backas she was hosting a show at the Latin Arts Festival where I was playing guitar in a backing band.  Since that time she launched an amazing singing career. But this is not the end of thestory, one wintry night in Orangeville I happened to meet Laura Fernandez at the annual HAMS party.  Laura is also an amazing singer / songwriter and now the new host of Cafe Latino!  So congratulations are in order to both these ladies for their positive life changes and this song is for you both.<br><br>Here's some links to check out:<br><br><strong>Amanda Martinez</strong><br><a href="http://www.myspace.com/amandamartinezsola">http://www.myspace.com/amandamartinezsola</a><br><a href="http://www.amandamartinez.ca/">http://www.amandamartinez.ca/</a><br><br><strong>Laura Fernandez</strong><br><a href="http://www.laurafernandezmusic.com/">http://www.laurafernandezmusic.com/</a><br><a href="http://www.myspace.com/laurafernandezband">http://www.myspace.com/laurafernandezband</a><br><br>There are also live recordings of the saturday night sessions.

This instrumental production dates back a few years to 2003, I was enjoying some personal freedom having just left a 5 year long industrial post and project. I was spending some time in the wilderness during the fall and winter.  This is a sonic sentiment rejoicing the quiet moments after solstice that we should all take periodically in life, a winter song that is to express a natural, yet perhaps not so obvious or logical mirror reflection of stillness against a busy life.<br><br>I have been working my way through the amazing BBC series "Planet Earth" released on DVD.  I am aware after a few segments about northern climates that wildlife and nature takes time off, takes timeout, the dark cold of winter inevitably brings about this natural slumber, the busy life of spring and summer is a mirror opposite reflection of this sleep, a natural balance of living life and taking time reflecting in silence.  Although seemingly brutal with many species going months without food, this slumber brings about rhythmic rejuvenation worthy of musical celebration.<br><br>Happy slumber and solstice to all!<br>See you in the spring,<br>PJ<div><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/11786743-7379622271666877436?l=peterjslack.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>

These books and the wonderful illustrations therein were the stuff of dreams as I was growing up.  Later in life I met the daughter of the fellow who was responsible for publishing this series of books and we are very old and dear friends to this day.  The books still sit on the bookshelf at my parent's home and are always there for next generation of kids who may require good references and reading material during their stay.<br><br>Today, through the thick and sometimes monotonous,modern accounting staples of living are these dreams and a sense of great purpose and mystery.  Today I imagine, like many others do, that the people of the earth are its seeds and that the ripening earth one day must let go the seeds, like a dying flower eventually must let go of its seeds with hopes and love to see them grow on their own.  For me, the sense of great danger with the precarious environment on earth is balanced by the mystery that always awaits us.

<br><div></div>
<br><div>Today I am grateful to be able to offer to you all, a humble trinket from a seemingly perpetual philosophy machine. Logic doesn&rsquo;t always prevail simply because the primordial paradox that continues to explode allows neither pure logic nor pure chaos to prevail. &ldquo;Never Lost&rdquo; is a song celebrating the dichotomies, without which, we would not exist nor would we have such rich lives. If you find yourself repeating clich&eacute;s like&rdquo; I&rsquo;ll never figure out women&rdquo; or &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never figure out men&rdquo;, consider that not being able to figure things out has nothing to do with gender. Also, if you find yourself very comfortable with the way things are, I recommend not getting too comfortable but instead, allow some of the strange things that occasionally happen in life to happen.<br>

     <!-- Display the item's primary content. -->
     Good Day to all fine people,<br><br><a href="http://www.pjslack.net/mothersgoingtomeltyourice.mp3">Song Track: Mother is Going to Melt Your Ice</a><br><br>I suppose I'll begin the introduction to this sad song by using an old cliche here: I'm not a pessimist, I'm a realist.  My new year's resolution every year from now on: I'm going to make the best of my life and do things that respect the lives and beliefs of others, respect and enhance our beautiful mother earth, and do things that naturally have respect for my own self and my own well being.  Writing country blues songs and love songs certainly can rank in all three of these categories as long as it causes people to stop and reflect in a positive and constructive way.  This has always been my intention for writing songs.<br><br>This is a blues / country song to add to the "Declassified" album project.  This is sort of a late addendum to resonate the theme in Al Gore's film, "An Inconvenient Truth". I can certainly remember winter when there were 20 foot snow banks along the road where I live; today only half a foot if any.  I can remember talking about all of the environmental issues, such as acid rain and greenhouse gas, when I was in grade school, thirty years ago.  Somewhere along the line I decided to join the popular consumer culture and ignore all of these messages and simply become a sleeping, dreaming skeptic like everyone else: in this life's dream everything is just wonderful no matter what we choose to do.  The lessons about impending doom that were conveyed were obviously lost in the interpretation of what life's dream is.  I find myself at a loss to tell you today what my dreams are beyond enjoying companionship with a happy, healthy family and friends.  I write songs to try and work out the answer to this difficult yet seemingly simple question.<br><br>This is a blunt declassification for you today: our life's dream is approaching a cataclysmic nightmare.  The green revolution and evolution itself will not come about in calm, happy transitions but rather cataclysmic changes of nature and free will that leave no choice in the matter but to change.  Successful form with harmonious sense of survival carries on and survives.<br><br>I am neither an anarchist nor pessimist but rather make these observations based on the irreversible and unstoppable nature of change itself. Successful life form on every scale becomes stubborn in a sheltered trough of calm and serene. This becomes the sense of balance and survival. This is survival inertia.  Collectively we become extensions of single calorie burning organisms and impact nature as a collective, external consciousness that devours the amount of energy required for the new and larger hungry life form satisfying a larger survival inertia.  The energy required to sustain the new collective life form is a quantum jump beyond what is required to sustain the sum of the individuals that make it up, this is the concept and physical manifestation of quantum consciousness.  A successful star in the cosmos will devour more mass until finally it dies and is reborn into the next larger form and then eventually, a black hole.  The propensity to consume and collect and the idea of "survival inertia" is not limited only to human nature and form but is a fabric of the universe.<br><br>There is great hope however because, most importantly and perhaps most profoundly, the sense of survival and way of survival is something that is communicated.  Mother earth is communicating to us, a requirement for a new paradigm of the collective sense of survival.  This is my interpretation for you in case you've missed the message:<br><br>Mother is Going to Melt Your Ice (Lyrics)<br><br>The fields are burning.<br>We've poisoned air.<br>Nature is turning<br>a war on this terror.<br><br>Hey hey!<br>Mother is going to melt your ice.<br><br>The east is yearning<br>for western fare.<br>Dollars churning<br>for plastic wares.<br><br>Hey hey!<br>Mother is going to melt your ice.<br><br>How green is your lawn?<br>How far does your tank of gas go?<br>When we reach the desert island,<br>won't matter any more.<br><br><br><br>(C)opyright 2007, Peter J Slack, SOCAN<div><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/11786743-116941861531709185?l=peterjslack.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>

<p>This past fall I participated in a benefit for the <a href="http://www.jaideechildrensfund.org/">Jai Dee Children's Fund</a> and we raised money to help build a school in Laos.  I wrote a song for the event and was asked by one of the elders of the community if I would record it.  I am pleased today to be able to offer you the recording of this song.  This is a blessing for the children of Laos and is a humble and simple musical exploration of the enchanting Khong Island in southern Laos. </p>

Send armies marching to destroy? Drop bombs on innocents? Slaughter one another?  Enslave on another? Together we live on this oasis. There's not a lot of good real estate to build our own Zion anywhere other than here on the great mother planet earth; our oasis in the universe.  The doorway to Zion, to individual peace and freedom, is to learn to dance with one another.

     The meaning of declassified is to reveal secrets, for example, through the declassification of secret documents.  The social conscience, however, reveals itself without the declassification of secret documents or news broadcasts.  Perhaps one of the most well guarded secrets is that the reason people are depressed is not because pharmaceutical companies need to exist by making pills to cure people's sadness.  Although this sounds like a ridiculous statement it is equally ridiculous that people feel they no longer have time or tolerance to be sad.  Equally as ludicrous, pharmaceutical companies and marketers of goods have convinced us that it is not normal to be without a sex drive.  Today there are many reasons to feel sadness and it is an inescapable part of living as a human being.

It is assumed that it was Cassini who first observed the Great Red Spot, however, it is unlikely that when Cassini made the observation that he considered whether the spot could be observing him.<br><br>If one accepted the gaia hypothesis as addition or otherwise fitting<br>with our clinical definition of life, then there would be no need to further question the existence of extra terrestrial life because we could simply begin to investigate the other planets in our solar system as conscious living systems.  Possibly the most difficult psychological hurtle for the human race would be to accept a view that we are conscious beings that make up part of a larger conscious being that is the earth and that each degree has free will that defies logic.  For sake of this hypothesis, put aside the notion that life and consciousness has to follow a strict clinical definition of what we can observe, dissect and calculate to consider and compare the larger living system of Jupiter with that of earth.<br><br>One of the observable traits common to living planets with complex internal workings is its weather system.  Collectively, life on earth contributes to the creation, the content and the shape of our atmosphere. In this respect, the human race through the observation and understanding of the universe has shaped the weather systems by applying this knowledge and understanding to lifestyle and to the taming of nature.  A gaia theorist could postulate that, in part through our actions, the earth weather system is an evolved complex system that has a memory and is aware and conscious of the universe; the earth can observe and store information of the surrounding universe through us.  A planet like Jupiter would not be able to sustain our forms life given the immense gravitational field yet there is potential mechanism that could shape the weather patterns on Jupiter through external universal influences: the great red spot.  The great red spot of Jupiter is still a mystery to scientists yet is it possible that it is part of the living system of Jupiter itself much as we are to the earth?  Is the great red spot an example of the inexplicable properties of life and free will?<br><br>Consider the great red spot as an engine that drives the rest of the weather patterns on Jupiter and then apply the butterfly effect discovered while attempting mathematical weather modeling; a small perturbation in temperature or pressure within the great red spot will have immense consequences to the unfolding patterns of the surrounding weather system.

This particular recording was in the radio spectrum and was slowed down 44 times to render in the audio range.  I decided to overlay some improvisational tracks over top of these tracks from the physics lab at U of IOWA for you. The original recording can and spectral graph can be found here:<br><br><a href="http://cassini.physics.uiowa.edu/space-audio/cassini/SKR1/">UNIVERSITY OF IOWA</a><br><br>I was excited to produce this particular track because earlier, and co-incidently, as part of the cat continuum project, I had simulated schumann resonance:<br><br><a href="http://www.oulu.fi/~spaceweb/textbook/schumann.html">SCHUMANN RESONANCE</a><br><br>and inserted it as backdrop for a live performance of "Heal the Children" at the Hugh's Room.  These types of planetary soundscapes seem to work very well for ambient and even folk tunes....ooppps!!!my secret is out!! :-)<br><br>These are very exciting and inspiring times to have these more intimate understandings and connections unfold to further express our place in the giant milky way: more fuel for music making.<br><br>Enjoy,<br><br>PJ Space Cadet<br>Music &amp; Words<br>Copyright 2005, Peter J Slack, SOCAN<div><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/11786743-112900050267967047?l=peterjslack.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>

<img src="http://www.pjslack.net/earth.jpg" alt=""><br><br>Good day once again fine people,<br><br><a href="http://www.pjslack.net/nadream.mp3">NORTH AMERICAN DREAM</a><br><br>I was considering this song for some time now and it sort of follows on the theme of relationships. The scale of this song however is much grander; it is a plea to mother earth that she is always there to tame our guiding social conscience with that of the earth conscience, or in other words, the relationship we have with the planet and beings we share it with.  In a sense, the relationship we have with ourselves is embedded in the relationships we have with others, is part of the relationship we have as communities, and furthermore is part of the relationship we have as nations on the planet.  The will of the earth is much larger than the will of all nations combined and follows a different set of controlling philosophies and balances.  The earth can shift and change our lives in an instant and, with certainty; we will all live our lives out together on this orb and share it with all other life forms. The moral of this short tale; our controls and balances of social conscience aren't necessarily friendly with the free will of mother Earth.<br><br>I suppose one can call this sort of a "stop and smell the roses" country/blues style....Enjoy<br><br>North American Dream<br><br>Follow me.<br>We climb to the top put our heads in the fog.<br>We shoot for the moon but we still hit the ground.<br>Mother Earth please follow me<br>Through this North American dream.<br><br>Shelter me.<br>We hide from the truth but we can't stop the pain.<br>We say that it's right and ignore when it's wrong.<br>Mother Earth please shelter me,<br>From this North American dream.<br><br>Frighten me<br>You speak through the trees with deep love from the ground<br>Your mind is a flash lightening strike to the clouds<br>Mother Earth please frighten me,<br>From this North American dream.<br><br>Set me free.<br>We go on our way and forget where we've been<br>We live out our lives disconnected it seems<br>Mother Earth please set me free,<br>From this North American dream.<br><br>Warm regards to all,<br>PJ<br><br>Words and Music<br>(C)opyright 2005, Peter J Slack, SOCAN<div><img width="1" height="1" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/tracker/11786743-112768917632385350?l=peterjslack.blogspot.com" alt=""></div>
